        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs of Potatos, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>3 cloves of Garlic, peeled *Optional*</li>
            <li>1 cup of Milk</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp of Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="directions">Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add potatos and garlic, lower heat to medium and allow to cook for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When potatos are slightly less cooked than fork tender, heat the butter and milk together until butter is melted.</li>
            <li>Drain water from potatos, and add potatos back into the dry pot with heat on low to evaporate remaining water.</li>
            <li>Slowly add milk and butter mixture, be sure to take care when mixing. Over mixing the potatos will cause a gummy texture to develop in the potatos, leading to a less than ideal dish.</li>
            <li>Finish with Salt, Pepper, and any other fixings you see fit.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
